# aic-objects-in-paintings-nextjs

This is the frontend application for the AIC Objects in Paintings project. [The backend is here](https://github.com/CogappLabs/aic-objects-in-paintings-data).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Duplicate .env.example and name it '.env.local'.

Note: If you’re using a remote ES server, you’ll need to set values for `ES_INDEX`, `ES_NODE` and `ES_API_KEY`. If you’re running the backend repo locally, you should be able to use the defaults.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
